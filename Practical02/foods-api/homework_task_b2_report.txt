Foods API Report
In the foods-api, app.use(express.json()) plays an important role by automatically parsing incoming JSON data so that it can be easily accessed through req.body. This object holds the data sent by the client, such as the name and calories fields needed when creating or updating a food item. Similarly, req.query is used to access any query parameters included in the URL, which is useful for filtering foods by name, like in a request to /foods?name=apple. Additionally, req.params.id helps capture the id from the URL path, allowing the server to identify exactly which food item needs to be updated or deleted.
The foods API also demonstrates the use of different HTTP methods, each corresponding to a specific CRUD operation. The GET method is tied to "Read" operations, allowing clients to retrieve either all food entries or a filtered set based on a query. The POST method is used for "Create," enabling clients to add new food items to the list. The PUT method handles "Update," making it possible to modify existing entries by specifying their unique IDs. Lastly, the DELETE method is linked to "Delete," removing specific food items from the system. Using these HTTP methods correctly ensures that the API follows RESTful design principles, keeping the behavior clear, predictable, and easy for developers to understand and use.
